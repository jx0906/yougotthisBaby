## Reflections: Challenges and Learning Points

If there can only be one word to describe the experience this round, it would be "whirlwind" - not just in the context of the increased components and routes I had to define but more so the overall emotional and mental load I had felt in this journey.  

I started off with great anticipation for this project due to the possibilities from the new technology frameworks, libraries and tools we had picked up. However, as the days past, I found myself struggling to apply the concepts we had learnt and thus slipping in the project timelines I had set for myself. It was also challenging to manage the project with my imminent delivery and there was undoubtedly many moments when it felt like this app was unlikely to see any daylight.  

Unlike the experience from the first project though, instead of choosing to tackle these challenges alone, I found myself reaching out to the instructors and peers for advice. The benefits were immense. Besides the opportunity to clarify our doubts, through the process, we also got to reinforce our own learning when we troubleshoot or did code reviews for each other. Through peer learning, I was also reminded of some critical traits every software engineer should possess - resourcefulness to troubleshoot and self-learn, tenacity and resilience to persevere and try again when almost every part of the code was breaking for no reason and more importantly, discipline and patience - to recognise when to take a break when things are muddled and seemingly at a standstill.
