Checklist for self:

- Use 3rd party API (quote of the day from Quotables) and Airtable
- Use React framework to build your application with at least
  5 components
  4 props
  2 useStates
  2 react router routes
  1 lifting state, which is used to implement CRUD on the client side
- Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, it should have a consistent and polished baby interface.
- Be deployed online (Vercel).
- Have full-CRUD single model operations somewhere within the app's features. For example, you can have functionality that Creates & Updates & Delete by implementing the ability to CRUD favourites.

## Planned future enhancements

a. Interactive form to facilitate tracking of developmental milestone events
b. Charts to facilitate tracking of child's development and activity records
c. Enhance form logic and UI
d. Include section for tracking of nursery items (eg, toys and going out necessities)
